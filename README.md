### Hi there 👋

I'm Charlie. I'm keen to see the renewables industry adopt and use open source code and practices, and also share data and knowledge in an open manner.

🔭 I'm contributing to NREL's OpenOA, but also creating "fun" python scripts, often associated with wind and renewable energy.

👯 If you're interested in the work I do, have an interesting project you think I might be interested, or want to collaborate on a project, just let me know :)
