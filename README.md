### Hi there 👋

I'm Charlie (he/him). I'm currently working in the renewables industry and I am pushing it to adopt and use more open source code and practices, and also share data and knowledge in an open manner.

🔭 I'm contributing to NREL's [OpenOA](https://github.com/NREL/OpenOA), but also creating "fun" python scripts, often associated with [wind and renewable energy](https://charlie9578.github.io/gallery/UK-WindAndSolar.html).

🧑‍🚀 I've released some of our wind farm SCADA data under an open license, please see [Kelmarsh](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5841833) and [Penmanshiel](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5946807), and I am further [supporting the use](https://www.wedowind.ch/code-space) of this data

🤓 I also like to play with open data myself, for example [data from OpenStreetMaps](https://charlie9578.github.io/gallery.html), and helping to improve it too

👯‍♂️ If you're interested in the work I do, have an interesting project you think I might be interested, or want to collaborate on a project, just let me know :)
